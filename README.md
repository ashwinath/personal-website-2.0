Revamp of the old website since now I have a better understanding of web-dev and Javascript in general.

A website to showcase my webdev skills and also to market myself as a developer. This is the code that powers [my website](https://ashwinchat.com).

Server side deployment has been fully automated and there is no need for human intevention.
